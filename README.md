# RSSscraper
A joint effort between myself and a business finance student to create a platform allowing us to conduct behavioural finance 
research using public information streams (RSS feeds, Twitter). At this point the project collates basic data on some financial
keywords, we plan on expanding it much further potentially with machine learning algoritms (we are currently studying this 
possibility).<br>
The project has been broken into two separate websites because the original host (Google App Engine) did not allow us to 
open a persistent stream with Twitter. I created a different poject and a website with a different host (Openshift) to 
consume the Twitter API.<br>
This is the RSS scraper project
